# Word World

- Write a C# program that takes a text and a pattern from the user and prints all the words in the text that corresponds to this pattern.
- The text contains only English alphabet letters and two punctuations dot (.) and comma (,).
- The pattern can contain letters, as well as either the character(s) of “*” or the character(s) of “-”, but not both of them.
- The symbol “*” corresponds to any number of letters (zero or more).
- The symbol “-“ corresponds to only one letter.

For example; if a pattern contains a single “*”, this symbol should match any number of letters in the word; the other characters in the word and pattern must be equal.
If the same word repeats more than one times, the program must print it only one time.
