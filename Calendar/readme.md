# Calendar

C# program that takes the followings from the user separately:
- two dates (day, month, and year) later than 01.01.2015
- a positive number (n)

and then prints each nth day between given dates. \
The program must also print the day of the week (i.e., Monday) and the season (Winter, Spring, Summer, or Autumn). \
The first date can be before or after the second date. \
The program should control all possible invalid user inputs and give an approriate error message. \
