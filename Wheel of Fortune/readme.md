# Wheel of Fortune

There is only one player. \
The game is played with a special wheel that determines the dollar value of the called letters. The wheel is split into 10 segments as follows: 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200, 300, 400, Bankrupt, and Bankrupt. \
\
The computer randomly determines a word and then a player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word should be an animal in English such as dog, cat, chicken, penguin, etc. \
\
The letters of the hidden word represented by tiles are face down. A player spins the wheel by naming the letters one-by-one to solve the puzzle. Both consonants and vowels can be guessed by the player after spinning the wheel. If the player guesses a letter that is part of the word, the computer writes it in all its correct positions. If the called letter cannot be found in the word, the player cannot earn any money from this turn. \
\
Before guessing a letter, a player must spin the wheel to determine how much each letter, if revealed. Every spin is risky because the wheel also includes bankrupt, resulting in the loss of all earnings to that point. \
\
The game is over when the player completes the whole word correctly. The player gets the money he/she earns.
